# Gender-Age-Prediction-Using-OpenCV
In this Project, I had used Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. I used the trained models to predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100) .
